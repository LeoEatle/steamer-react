### Steamer-React
[AlloyTeam](http://alloyteam.github.io/) React Stater Kit

### Template
We create seperate branches for different templates which have different features
* [react](https://github.com/SteamerTeam/steamer-react/tree/react)
	- react web starter kit
	- already adopt well-performed methods on react development
* [react-isomorphic](https://github.com/SteamerTeam/steamer-react/tree/react-isomorphic)
	- react web and isomorphic development starter kit
	- koa as backend service
	- fast for using alloyteam internal isomorphic platform
	- fits for external use too
* [react-simple](comming soon)
	- very simple react web starter kit
	- without sprites
	- still well-performed

### How to start
You can use git command to clone the branches you want. For example, if you wanna get react-isomorphic, you can type the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/SteamerTeam/steamer-react.git -b react-isomorphic
```

If you only need the latest files with git function, you can add `--depth` option for your command:

```
git clone https://github.com/SteamerTeam/steamer-react.git -b react-isomorphic --depth=1
```
